 In the Name of Allah, the Maker of everything in existence!  This project features a straightforward math game implemented in Python. It poses ten basic mathematical questions to the user, covering addition, subtraction, and multiplication. After completing the game, the user receives a final score.  During the game, if the user finds a question challenging, they can input "hard", prompting the program to present a new problem. The user will still earn points for that question.  Please note that this is a beginner-level project and does not include any advanced features or graphical buttons at this stage.
